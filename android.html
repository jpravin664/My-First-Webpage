                Its insane popularity may be easing up, but Among Us remains a fun game that has the potential to ruin friendships. It's a game about deception. Anywhere from five to 10 players gather and perform tasks in space. There's an impostor among you, though â€” sometimes a few of them).
<br><br>
The regular crewmates must survive the impostor, who tries to kill everyone. A good impostor turns the team against each other, throwing blame off themselves. It's usually a fun time. <br><br><br>

                There's a good reason why shooter games are so incredibly popular among Android users. They challenge your aim, decision-making skills, and tactical abilities. 

Whether it's first-person or third, you can bet that these best Android games will satisfy that shooter itch.
<br><br>
Apex Legends, the hit free-to-play battle royale, has come to mobile. It's an awesome first-person shooter that feels very much like the original game. While the touchscreen controls feel a bit cramped, you can use a controller (and we recommend you do so). You have a few legends to choose from at the outset, with more unlocked as you level up.
<br><br>
Experience the thrilling gunplay, huge World's Edge map, and adrenaline-packed matches where you vie for supremacy. If you've never played a battle royale, Apex Legends is probably one of the best to try out.

                As of today, Free Fire certainly requires no introduction; itâ€™s only one of the most popular mobile battle royale games in existence, surpassing the likes of PUBG Mobile, Call of Duty: Mobile, and other games in the genre. Free Fire has over 60-million user reviews, as well as over 500-million downloads on the Play Store, which is no small feat indeed. <br><br>
                Originally released in September 2017 as a beta for Android and iOS, Free Fire arrived at a time when battle royales were still relatively new. In fact, the first beta of the game was released even before PUBG had landed on PC, the latter of which launched the entire genre into mainstream appeal. This rise in popularity of battle royales, coupled with the growing interest in mobile gaming, made Free Fire one of the most downloaded titles in the Play Store, a title that they still hold today, 3 years later.
<br><br>
                Free Fire is developed by 111 Dots Studio using Unity 3D, an engine that is popular among indie developer studios since itâ€™s free and has a wide variety of assets readily available for downloading. The engine is also very versatile and gives plenty of features and creative freedom for those who master its intricacies.
